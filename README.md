This project is a stock market simulator. When you first clone this repo, there are a few things you need to do before you can host your own stock market simulator:

1. From the root directory of your project, run:
`$ python utils/initialize.py`
2. Request an api key from the financial times [here](https://developer.ft.com/member/register).
3. Write your finincial times key to the file `utils/ftkey`.

Finally, to run the simulator, from the root directory of your project, run:
`$ python app.py`

Enjoy!
